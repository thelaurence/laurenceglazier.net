I have never been a very active bloggist, but I like having a quiet place to
post some things. After a couple years of self hosting my blog on an old desktop
in my closet, I finally got tired of trying to keep a web server up all the
time.

So I started looking around looking for a simpler alternative. I realized that
my site had never been anything more than a small collection of static posts,
that I kind of prefer writing in emacs to writing in a web GUI, and that it's
very unlikely that I would ever hit the GitHub Pages [usage limits]
(https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/#usage-limits). A small
static site seemed like the right way to go for my simple purposes.

Took me a little bit of time to figure out how to get set up using Hugo, but all
in all, it was pretty easy. I like my new setup so far. It's way easier than
what I was doing before.
