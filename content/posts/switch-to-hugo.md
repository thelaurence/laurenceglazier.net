***Switched to Hugo. Free static hosting on GitHub. Happy.***

I have never been an active bloggist, but I like having a blog.

I got sick of maintaining my own web server.

So I started poking around looking for a simple alternative. My blog always
was basically a small collection of static posts, and, as a programmer, I'm
accustomed to working in a regular text editor, and feel no need for a
fancy web portal.

Hugo + GitHub works great for this.

No more hassling with web server :)
