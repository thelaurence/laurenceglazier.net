I have never been a very active bloggist, but I like having a quiet place to 
post some things. After a couple years of self hosting my blog on an old laptop
in my closet, I finally got tired of trying to keep a web server up all the
time.

So I started poking around looking for a simple alternative. I realized that my
site had never been anything more than a small collection of static posts, that
I prefer writing in a plain old text editor to writing in a fancy web portal,
and discovered you can host small amounts of static content on GitHub.

That led me to Hugo. Hugo + GitHub works great for this. At my methodical pace,
it only took a few hours to set up Hugo, pick a theme, get things configured,
export all my posts from my old blog, and finally re-create them as `.md` files
for Hugo to render into static pages.

So far, so good.
