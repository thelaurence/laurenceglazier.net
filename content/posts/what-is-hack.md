### hack

*verb* | \\Ëˆhak\\

1. *n.* Originally, a quick job that produces what is needed, but not well.

Anything on this blog bearing the [hack](../tags/hack) tag will probably fall under the first of these two definitions. I anticipate that such posts will generally be more entertaining than useful.
