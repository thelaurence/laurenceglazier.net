      <description>I have never been a very active bloggist, but I like having a quiet place to post some things. After a couple years of self hosting my blog on an old laptop in my closet, I finally got tired of trying to keep a web server up all the time.
So I started poking around looking for a simple alternative. I realized that my site had never been anything more than a small collection of static posts, that I prefer writing in a plain old text editor to writing in a fancy web portal, and discovered you can host small amounts of static content on GitHub.</description>

      <title>What is a Hack?</title>

      <description>hack verb | \Ëˆhak\
 n. Originally, a quick job that produces what is needed, but not well.  Anything on this blog bearing the hack tag will probably fall under the first of these two definitions. I anticipate that such posts will generally be more entertaining than useful.</description>
