      <description>I have never been a very active bloggist, but I like having a quiet place to post some things. After a couple years of self hosting my blog on an old desktop in my closet, I finally got tired of trying to keep a web server up all the time.
So I started looking around looking for a simpler alternative. I realized that my site had never been anything more than a small collection of static posts, that I kind of prefer writing in emacs to writing in a web GUI, and that it&amp;rsquo;s very unlikely that I would ever hit the GitHub Pages usage limits.</description>
