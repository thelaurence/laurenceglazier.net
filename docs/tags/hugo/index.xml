      <description>I have never been a very active bloggist, but I like having a quiet place to post some things. After a couple years of self hosting my blog on an old laptop in my closet, I finally got tired of trying to keep a web server up all the time.
So I started poking around looking for a simple alternative. I realized that my site had never been anything more than a small collection of static posts, that I prefer writing in a plain old text editor to writing in a fancy web portal, and discovered you can host small amounts of static content on GitHub.</description>
